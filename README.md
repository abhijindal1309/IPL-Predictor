# IPL-Predictor
## Introduction
Winning in Cricket depends on various factors like home crowd advantage, performances in the past, experience in the match, performance at the specific venue, performance against the specific team and the current form of the player. The result is either a win, lose or a tie. So I used Machine Learning to predict the outcome of the match as well as final score after each innings. In my project, I have used two models, first predicts the score of first innings not only on the basis of current run rate but also considers number of wickets fallen, momentum in last 5 overs, batting and bowling team team. The second method predicts the outcome of the match in the second innings considering the same attributes as of the former method along with the target given to the batting team. These two methods have been implemented using Linear Regression and Random Forest Algorithm for first innings and Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes for second innings.
